                        <b>The Challenge</b>
The previous website failed to reflect Aquarela Analytics’ recent rebranding and did not effectively engage its target audience, particularly C-level executives. The outdated design and misalignment with the company’s new brand strategy created a disconnect with potential clients and partners. The challenge was to create a website that not only resonated with the brand’s refreshed image but also provided a user experience that appealed to high-level decision-makers.
<br><br>
<b>Research</b>
To address these challenges, the brand book was revisited to review and redefine essential elements, including the brand DNA, semantic panel, semantic map, values, purpose, The Golden Circle, positioning, brand personality, archetypes, tone of voice, and brand usage. This comprehensive review ensured that the new design would be fully aligned with the updated brand identity, while also meeting the expectations of the market and the needs of its executive audience.
<br><br>
<b>Build</b>
The rebranding process involved developing a new website that maintained Aquarela’s vibrant and colorful identity while adapting to current market trends and user expectations. The site was carefully crafted to reflect the revitalized brand image and connect more effectively with the target audience, especially C-level executives. Modern design principles and UX/UI best practices were employed to ensure the website was not only visually appealing but also functional and user-friendly.
<br><br>
<b>Usability Test</b>
A strong emphasis on UX led to usability testing with C-level executives from Aquarela Analytics, who represent the primary target audience. Their feedback was crucial in refining the final design, ensuring that the website met the high standards of usability and effectiveness expected by top-level decision-makers. This process ensured the site aligned with the brand’s identity and provided a seamless user experience.
<br><br>
<b>Next Steps</b>
In line with our commitment to continuous improvement, the next phase involves conducting additional usability tests to identify opportunities for further enhancements. These iterative tests will allow us to fine-tune the website’s functionality and design, ensuring it remains responsive to user needs and consistent with Aquarela Analytics’ dynamic brand identity. By staying adaptable, we aim to keep the platform optimized and effective in meeting the company’s strategic objectives.</p>
